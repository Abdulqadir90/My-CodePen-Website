       <h3>3 Major Accomplishments of Muhammad Ali</h3>
         <h4>He won the gold medal in light heavyweight division at the 1960 olympic</h4>
         <p>Clay won his first three fights at the Olympics with two unanimous decisions and a second-round knockout. In the final, he faced three-time European champion Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland. After being dominated by his opponent in the first two rounds, Clay found top form in the third round mauling his opponent and almost securing a knock-out. Clay was declared winner by all the judges making him the light heavyweight Olympic champion.</p>
     <h4><strong>At 22 years, he was the youngest boxer to unseat a reigning heavyweight champion</strong></h4><p>The fight took place on February 25, 1964. After a close beginning, Clay dominated the sixth round hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston didn’t turn up for the seventh round and Clay was declared winner by technical knockout (TKO). The victory made Cassius Clay, at age 22, the youngest boxer to unseat a reigning heavyweight champion. Moreover, Sports Illustrated magazine ranked Clay’s victory as the fourth greatest sports moment of the 20th century..</p>
           <h4><strong>HE FOUGHT THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY AGAINST JOE FRAZIER</strong></h4><p> Soon after the Liston fight, Clay publicly converted to Islam and took the name Muhammad Ali. After his refusal to be inducted into the armed forces, Ali was not allowed to fight from March 1967 to October 1970. In Ali’s absence, Joe Frazier had collected two championship belts through knockouts. Thus when Ali returned, it set the stage for a fight between him and Frazier with both having a legitimate claim to the title of World Heavyweight Champion. Moreover, both Muhammad Ali (31–0, 25 KOs) and Joe Frazier (26–0, 23 KOs) were undefeated making it the first time that two undefeated boxers fought each other for the heavyweight title. There was a massive promotional hype for the fight and it exceeded even those expectations. Held on March 8, 1971 at Madison Square Garden, it lasted the full 15-round championship distance and was very closely fought. However, in the end, Frazier retained his title with a unanimous decision handing Ali his first professional defeat. Nonetheless Ali became part of what has been termed as the Fight of the Century and been rated by many as the biggest sporting event in history.</p>

         <p>We fought in 1974 - that was a long time ago. After 1981, we became the best of friends. By 1984, we loved each other. I am not closer to anyone else in this life than I am to Muhammad Ali. Why? We were forged by that first fight in Zaire, and our lives are indelibly linked by memories and photographs, as young men and old men.</p>
